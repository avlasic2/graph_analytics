# Link predictions of weighted directed acyclic graphs
The algorithm is impementation of the patent pending method titled [Entity resource recommendation system based on interaction vectorization](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0a/ed/f5/47c57355c3ef30/US20200151597A1.pdf). The method is based of off [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) and [Complex Embeddings for Simple Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06357.pdf) which seeks to minimize ```math ||embed1 \cdot Matrix embed2 - E[log(weight)] || ```
